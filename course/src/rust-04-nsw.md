## Start from the Product You Already Have

Day 2 ended with one five-row table and one SQL query running through IVFFlat. Run it again from the repository
root:

```sh
cargo run -p vector-db-from-scratch-datafusion-starter --example ivfflat_sql
```

The seeded IVFFlat plan contains `index=ivf_flat`, and its `LIMIT 3` result is:

```text
(1, one)
(2, two)
(3, three)
```

Day 3 keeps that query and fixture fixed. What changes is how the core index proposes candidate row offsets:
IVFFlat probes centroid lists, while navigable small world (NSW) search follows edges in a proximity graph. DataFusion's
bounded `SortExec` still owns final SQL ordering.

The cumulative starter already contains these two files:

```text
vector-db-starter/core/src/graph.rs
vector-db-starter/core/src/nsw.rs
```

You own four TODOs:

1. `search_layer`;
2. `prune_neighbors`;
3. `NswIndex::try_new`; and
4. `NswIndex::search_with_ef`.

The same starter also declares `greedy_search`, HNSW, and IVF-PQ surfaces for later days. Leave those future TODOs
alone. The supplied crate-internal tests let you finish one NSW boundary at a time without making graph helpers public.

## Checkpoint 1: Search One Supplied Layer

An NSW graph has no centroid that points directly at the query. Search begins from one or more entry points and explores
their connected neighbors.

![One entry point begins the NSW walk](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-1.svg)

![A greedy step moves to a closer neighbor](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-2.svg)

For top-k search, keep three pieces of state:

- `C`, a min-heap whose nearest candidate is the next vertex to expand;
- `W`, a bounded max-heap whose top is the worst retained result; and
- `visited`, a set that prevents a row from being measured or expanded twice.

Seed all three from the valid, unique entry points.

![Seed the candidate and result frontiers](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-3.svg)

Pop the nearest item from `C`. For each unseen neighbor, compute its distance once. If it can improve `W`, add it to
both frontiers and trim `W` back to the search width.

![Expand the nearest candidate and update both frontiers](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-4.svg)

A candidate may add nothing because all its neighbors were already visited. Other pending candidates can still continue
the search.

![Visited neighbors are not expanded twice](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-5.svg)

Multiple entry points can reach different graph regions, but no heap width can cross a disconnected component without an
entry point or edge into it.

![A second entry point opens another region](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-6.svg)

`W` retains only the nearest vertices found within the current width.

![The result frontier keeps the nearest visited vertices](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-7.svg)

When `W` is full and the nearest pending candidate is **strictly worse** than `W.worst`, this bounded NSW search stops.

![The nearest pending candidate is worse than the full result frontier](./vector-db/05-nsw-explore-8.svg)

The strict comparison matters. A candidate equal to `W.worst` must still be expanded. This stopping rule limits work; it
does not prove that every unseen path is worse, because a worse intermediate vertex could lead to a closer vertex later.

```text
C = valid unique entry points as a min-heap by distance
W = the same points as a bounded max-heap by distance
visited = the same row offsets

while C is not empty:
    candidate = C.pop_nearest()
    if W is full and candidate is strictly worse than W.worst:
        break

    for neighbor in candidate.neighbors:
        if neighbor is outside allowed_rows or already visited:
            continue
        mark neighbor visited
        measure its distance once
        if W is not full or neighbor is better than W.worst:
            C.push(neighbor)
            W.push(neighbor)
            trim W to the search width

return W from nearest to farthest
```

Implement `search_layer` in `graph.rs`. Clamp `ef` to at least one and at most `allowed_rows`; return no rows when
none are allowed. Ignore duplicate or out-of-range entry points. During insertion, `allowed_rows = r` means only
previous rows `0..r` exist.

Run only this checkpoint's supplied test:

```sh
cargo test -p vector-db-from-scratch-core-starter \
  graph_tests::day_03_search_layer_respects_bounds_and_expands_equal_frontier -- --exact
```

Before the implementation it reaches the Day 3 traversal TODO. Afterward it checks allowed rows, disconnected
components, duplicate and invalid entry points, nearest-first uniqueness, and the strict-worse stopping boundary.

**Prediction:** If every entry point is in one of two disconnected components, why can increasing `ef` not return a row
from the other component?

## Checkpoint 2: Keep a Bounded Neighbor List

Rows are inserted one at a time. Search the graph built so far with width `ef_construction`, then choose at most
`max_connections` neighbors for the new row.

![Choose the new vector's nearest graph neighbors](./vector-db/05-nsw-insert-1.svg)

Adding reciprocal edges can push an existing endpoint over the degree cap.

![New reciprocal edges can exceed the degree cap](./vector-db/05-nsw-insert-2.svg)

Implement `prune_neighbors` in `graph.rs`. Deduplicate the supplied neighbor rows, order them by distance from the
owner, break distance ties by row offset, and truncate to `max_connections`.

![Choose the connections that survive pruning](./vector-db/05-nsw-insert-3.svg)

Run the crate-internal helper test:

```sh
cargo test -p vector-db-from-scratch-core-starter \
  graph_tests::day_03_prune_neighbors_is_deterministic_and_bounded -- --exact
```

Its direct fixture is self-free and isolates deduplication, ordering, tie-breaking, and the cap. The graph builder—not
this synthetic helper input—owns the invariant that no adjacency list contains its own row.

## Checkpoint 3: Build a Reciprocal Graph

Implement `NswIndex::try_new` in `nsw.rs`.

Validate stored vectors for the selected metric before building. The graph budget must satisfy:

- `max_connections > 0`;
- `ef_construction >= max_connections`; and
- `ef_search > 0`.

Add the first row without searching. For each later row `r`, search only `0..r`, add reciprocal edges to the selected
neighbors, and prune every affected endpoint. If pruning removes `a -> b`, also remove `b -> a`.

![Pruning leaves a bounded reciprocal graph](./vector-db/05-nsw-insert-4.svg)

The completed graph must be deterministic, duplicate-free, self-free, reciprocal, and within the configured degree cap.
Run its focused construction test:

```sh
cargo test -p vector-db-from-scratch-core-starter --test indexes \
  day_03_nsw_rejects_invalid_build_configuration_and_builds_a_bounded_reciprocal_graph -- --exact
```

This test owns stored-vector and configuration validation plus the built-graph invariants. It does not require
`search_with_ef`.

## Checkpoint 4: Query with a Width Budget

Implement `NswIndex::search_with_ef`.

Validate the query for dimension, finite values, and the selected metric. Reject a zero search width. Search from the
graph entry point with `ef_search.max(k)`, return at most `k` rows, and keep them nearest-first.

The `.max(k)` floor separates the requested result count from the caller's exploration hint: asking for five rows with
`ef_search = 1` still needs a result frontier that can hold five rows.

Run the query test:

```sh
cargo test -p vector-db-from-scratch-core-starter --test indexes \
  day_03_nsw_search_validates_widens_and_matches_exact_on_connected_fixture -- --exact
```

It checks query validation, zero width, the `ef_search.max(k)` floor, ordering, and one connected high-width fixture that
matches `FlatIndex`. That equality is an observation about this fixture, not a claim that NSW is exact for arbitrary
data, widths, or disconnected graphs.

## Return to the Same SQL Product

Now run the supplied, TODO-free comparison:

```sh
cargo run -p vector-db-from-scratch-datafusion-starter --example nsw_sql
```

It executes the same five-vector cosine query twice. The first plan contains:

```text
VectorIndexScanExec: index=ivf_flat, metric=Cosine, query_dim=3, fetch=Some(3), ordered=false
```

The second contains:

```text
VectorIndexScanExec: index=nsw, metric=Cosine, query_dim=3, fetch=Some(3), ordered=false
```

Both retain the supplied `SortExec` and show the same three rows:

```text
(1, one)
(2, two)
(3, three)
```

The example demonstrates the Day 2 → Day 3 handoff through the existing attachment, matcher, source-row lookup,
and final sort. Equal rows here do not establish general recall, work, or performance.

Keep the separate five-result SQL fixture green:

```sh
cargo test -p vector-db-from-scratch-datafusion-starter --test sqllogictest day_03_nsw_sql -- --exact
```

That SQLLogicTest uses a different eight-row fixture and `LIMIT 5`. It verifies `index=nsw`, the supplied final sort,
and its own five expected rows. Unsupported SQL shapes continue to use the supplied exact path.

## Day 3 Review

Run the Day 3 focused gate, then the cumulative course through Day 3:

```sh
cargo x test-day 3
cargo x test-through 3
```

Choose one insertion and one query and explain:

- why `C` and `W` need opposite heap orderings;
- why the stopping comparison is strict;
- how a rejected edge is removed from both endpoints;
- why `ef_search.max(k)` is necessary; and
- why a disconnected component remains unreachable without an entry point or edge into it.

Keep Day 3 to one immutable graph layer. Hierarchy, deletion, concurrent mutation, persistence, filtered pushdown,
general DDL/catalog behavior, benchmarking, and neighbor-diversification heuristics belong outside this checkpoint.
